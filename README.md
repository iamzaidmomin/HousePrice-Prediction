# HousePrice-Prediction
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository hosts a machine learning model and dataset for predicting house prices based on key features, including the number of toilets, bathrooms, and square footage.

Project Highlights:

Data Exploration: Dive into the world of real estate data, where we explore and analyze the relationships between house prices and essential attributes.

Machine Learning Model: Discover how we build and fine-tune a powerful machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on the provided features.

Evaluation: Understand the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance and its ability to make precise price predictions.

Interactive Notebooks: Explore Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code snippets that demonstrate our data preprocessing, model training, and prediction processes.

Key Features:

Predict house prices with high accuracy.
Gain insights into the influence of toilets, bathrooms, and square footage on house prices.
Learn about machine learning techniques for regression tasks.
Explore a real-world dataset and learn how to handle data for predictive modeling.
Get Started:

Feel free to clone this repository and explore the code, data, and notebooks. If you're passionate about real estate or machine learning, this project provides a valuable learning experience and practical insights into the world of house price prediction.
